# Machine Learning Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on various clinical parameters. The model is trained using structured health data.

## Features
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Implements classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
- **Feature Engineering**: Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- Age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators.
- Labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kilofrakh/Machine-Learning-Heart-Disease-Prediction-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Heart-Disease-Prediction-
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and evaluation.

## Model Performance
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**
- **Classification Report**

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of deep learning models for improved accuracy
- Deployment as a web-based prediction tool
